		<h1>My First HTML Page</h1>
		<p>Hi! my Name is <strong>Erick Kamau</strong> and I am learning HTML because it is essential for anyone interested in creating or maintaining websites to have a basic understanding of HTML. By learning HTML, one can easily create and design their own website, customize it according to their preferences and make it user-friendly. </p>
		<h2>My Motivation</h2>
		<p>Learning HTML is the foundation of designing and building websites. HTML is the language of the web, and a basic skill for anyone who wishes to create or work with digital content. With HTML, I can design and structure web pages, create hyperlinks, insert images and videos, and much more. It is also an essential skill for anyone who wants to pursue a career in web development. </p>
